    "description": [
      "I'm a software engineer with 9+ years of professional experience in backend development, distributed systems, and cloud infrastructure. Currently at Spinny, building scalable automotive-tech solutions. Over the years, I've worked across diverse domains ‚Äî automotive, gaming, fintech, blockchain, entertainment ‚Äî with a strong focus on building systems that are scalable, secure, and reliable.",
      "At Zynga, I spent 5 years working on FarmVille 2 & 3, where I optimized performance for millions of players, cut pre-release times from hours to minutes, and built automation frameworks. At BookMyShow, I developed identity management systems and real-time monitoring tools. After Zynga, I took time to explore emerging technologies and evaluate strategic career moves before joining Fancraze, where I led engineering initiatives for cricket NFT platform. Now at Spinny, I'm focusing on building robust backend systems for India's largest used car platform.",
      "I believe in pragmatic problem-solving, mentoring teams, and designing systems that balance performance with long-term maintainability. I value being intentional about career transitions, using these periods to stay updated with industry trends and make thoughtful decisions about the next challenge. Outside work, I enjoy writing about tech, conducting mock interviews, and helping developers grow through mentorship."
